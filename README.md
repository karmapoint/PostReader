# PostReader - inspired by feedly

[PostReader live link](https://www.postreader.net)

PostReader is a browser-based RSS reader inspired by [feedly link](http://www.feedly.com). It is a full-stack web application utilizing Ruby on Rails, a PostgreSQL database, and React on the frontend, implemented utilizing the Redux methodology.

The entire project was conceived, designed, and implemented in a strict two-week timeframe, although I look forward to revisiting it in the future to continue development.
